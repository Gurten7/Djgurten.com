    <h1>Biography</h1>
<div class="bio-content">
  <p>
    Behind the decks of Europe’s hottest clubs and the madness of KDW stands one name: <strong>DJ Gûrten</strong>.  
    Known for his genre-defying sets, explosive drops, and magnetic stage presence, Gûrten has become an unstoppable force in the Dutch electronic scene – and far beyond.
  </p>
  <p>
    But before the mainstage lights, before the fireworks and the global tour banners, there was a boy with a discman, a dream, and a slightly too loud speaker at his first backyard party in Lichtenvoorde. 
    From spinning CDs at teenage birthdays to bootleg mashups that mysteriously started circulating in underground forums, Gûrten’s rise was as unconventional as his sound.
  </p>
  <p>
    He first broke through during the legendary <em>Soundlab Nights Sessions</em> – that have become folklore – where his fusion of beach beats, underground techno and unexpected brass stabs left crowds breathless and barefoot.
    Word spread fast. From Belgrade to Dublin , and from secret warehouse raves to velvet-lined VIP lounges, DJ Gûrten didn’t just play – he <em>transformed</em> the room.
  </p>
  <p>
    By 2024, he was the not-so-secret weapon of festival lineups and private events that needed that one unforgettable set. By 2025, he had his own merch empire, 
    a cult following in both Ibiza and Houten, and an unofficial fanbase known only as <strong>De Gûrtengang</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, in 2026, he’s taking things up a notch – or ten – with his first international headline tour: <em>Color of Sounds</em>. Expect pounding EDM, saxophone solos that send chills, and…
    rooftop house anthems, Berlin-style techno kicks, Ibiza sunrise moments, Parisian electro chic, hypnotic loops from Tulum, London grime flashes, and global Gûrten madness!
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether it’s sunset at Ushuaïa, a mystery set at KDW '26, or a pop-up party in a Berlin parking garage – <strong>DJ Gûrten delivers. Every. Single. Time.</strong>
